# Drug-net
A project focused on the development of gene-association networks for combination of bacteriophage-antibiotic drug treatments and E. coli genes using datasets for antibiotic-gene and bacteriophage-gene interactions.

Data files came from the impact of antibacterial treatments on bacteria and also bacteriophage treatments. 
  - Positive score indicated upregulation of those genes and negative scores indicated downregulation of genes.
  - Bacteriophage treatments were done at different temepratures
  - From synergostic and antagonistic relationships were assessed between drugs and phage treatments to see which combinations may possibily work in similar pathways


**Goal of this project:**
  From there we will be looking at these antibiotic-phage drug pairs to see if the genes they impact belong or work in the same biological pathways.
